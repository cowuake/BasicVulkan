Simple Vulkan Demo employing SDL2 (hard WIP)
The project originates from a refactoring of [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/YukiSnowy/dc31f47448ac61dd6aedee18b5d53858)

## Run the demo
The project has been configured to be built with CMake.
Only tested on Fedora Linux relying on VSCode with the "CMake Tools" extension installed: with this setup, running the demo should be as trivial as opening the folder in the editor, selecting a kit and launching a debug session.
